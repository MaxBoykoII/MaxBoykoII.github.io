export const aboutText = `I am an aspiring web developer with a background in mathematics and a passion for the MEAN stack. Armed with a strong foundation in JavaScript, including the ES6 update, I have experience using popular libraries like jQuery, React, and Angular 2 to build web apps with a node backend. My toolkit also features TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Sass, and Bootstrap. At Code School and Pluralsight, I continue to learn more about web development and its best practices./n
 Previous experience includes building web apps for GoldMinerPulse and working on projects at freeCodeCamp involving jQuery, React, Angular 2, Express, and soon D3. To showcase the new GoldMinerPulse API and let clients test different ways of investing in gold stocks, I developed an Angular app, which I have now updated and extended to use Angular 2. Check out the alpha release <a href="https://www.goldminerpulse.com/_demo789/public/" target="_blank">here</a>./n
 At university, fellow students knew me as an intrepid problem solver and a motivated team player, making me much sought after for collaboration on assignment questions and projects. I also work well alone and enjoy figuring out ways to leverage new technologies./n
 I am looking to pursue opportunities in the USA (I am a citizen) and can be reached by email at maxboykomax@gmail.com. Contact me today to find out what I can do for you!/n
